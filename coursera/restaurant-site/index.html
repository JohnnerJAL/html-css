                    <h3>Chicken</h3>
                    <p>Our chicken dishes are prepared with free-range, organic chicken that is hormone and antibiotic-free. We source our poultry from local farms that prioritize animal welfare and sustainable practices.</p>
                    
                    <p>Signature dishes include our Herb-Roasted Chicken with seasonal vegetables and natural jus, and the popular Chicken Piccata with lemon-caper sauce and garlic mashed potatoes. For those seeking something with a bit more spice, our Chipotle Chicken features a smoky marinade and is served with roasted corn salsa.</p>
                    
                    <p>We also offer a variety of chicken sandwiches for lunch service, including our famous Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich with house-made pickles and spicy aioli. All chicken dishes can be modified to be gluten-free upon request.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our chefs use a variety of cooking techniques to bring out the best in chicken - from slow-roasting to grilling to sous-vide preparation. Each method is chosen to maximize flavor and tenderness while preserving the natural qualities of the meat.</p>
                    
                    <p>For those looking for lighter options, we offer several chicken salads featuring fresh, locally-sourced greens and vegetables. Our Mediterranean Chicken Salad combines grilled chicken with kalamata olives, feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a lemon-herb vinaigrette.</p>
                    
                    <p>We believe in using the whole bird, which is why you'll find chicken stock as the base for many of our soups and sauces. This approach minimizes waste and maximizes flavor throughout our menu.</p>

                    <p>Our Braised Short Ribs are slow-cooked for 8 hours until fork-tender, served with creamy polenta and seasonal vegetables. This dish showcases our commitment to using less expensive cuts transformed through time-honored cooking techniques.</p>
                    
                    <p>We offer several steakhouse classics including Beef Wellington for two, prepared with mushroom duxelles and wrapped in puff pastry. Our chefs carefully source the beef tenderloin for this dish, ensuring the perfect texture and flavor profile.</p>
                    
                    <p>All our beef dishes are accompanied by house-made sauces including béarnaise, red wine reduction, and green peppercorn.

                    <p>Our Nigiri selection features daily fresh catches that may include Bluefin Tuna, Hamachi, Scottish Salmon, and Japanese Sea Bass. Each piece is hand-formed and served with a touch of wasabi between the fish and rice - the traditional Tokyo style.</p>
                    
                    <p>Signature rolls include the Food LLC Special Roll with spicy tuna, avocado, and cucumber inside, topped with seared salmon, tobiko, and our special sauce.

This chef's choice menu showcases the season's best offerings and the chef's creative vision.</p>
